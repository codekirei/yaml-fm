## How To

1. Install extra deps with `npm i`
2. Run example with `node index.js`
3. ????
4. Profit!!!

## Please Note

- This example requires modules that are not required by `yaml-fm`
- Because of relative pathing, `index.js` must be called from inside the `example` dir.
  If you call it from the parent `yaml-fm` dir, it will return an empty array, and you will be sad.
